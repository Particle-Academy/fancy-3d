[![Fancified](art/fancified.svg)](https://particle.academy)

**An engine-agnostic core for blending 3D engines and 2D web components into Mixed Reality UX.** fancy-3d is the bridge layer where react-fancy components, *any* 3D engine, and 2D pan/zoom canvases compose into a single authoring surface — designed for humans and agents to build rich, data-driven 3D and MR applications without picking sides.

> **fancy-3d bundles no WebGL engine and has no Babylon (or three.js) dependency.** The core ships JSON-friendly `Scene` types, the engine-pluggable `<Canvas>` with a built-in DOM/CSS-3D renderer, and shape/layout helpers — all framework-light. WebGL engines plug in via **optional sibling adapter packages** that mirror each other's API: [`@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon) (Babylon) and [`@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three) (three.js). Use one, both, or neither.

## What's inside

- **`<Canvas>`** — engine-pluggable 2D pan/zoom surface. **Defaults to `engine="dom"`** (CSS3D matrix projection, no WebGL dependency). Opt into a WebGL backend by passing an adapter engine — `babylonEngine` from `@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon/engine` or `threeEngine` from `@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three/engine` — or any object implementing `CanvasEngine` (native canvas / WebXR / your own). The 2D node graph and the 3D scene root live alongside each other; this is the foundation for hybrid 2D-in-3D and MR scenes.
- **Shape primitives, layout helpers, JSON-friendly Scene types** — terse, agent-authorable scene descriptions; engine-agnostic.
- **`<Stage>` / `<Monitor>` / `<Card3D>`** — the 3D scene primitives + 3D-native widgets ship from the **adapter packages** (`@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon/react`, `@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three/react`), *not* from fancy-3d core, since they need a concrete WebGL engine. (`<Monitor>` was `<Screen>` before v0.3.0.)

## Why fancy-3d exists

Most 3D libraries force a choice between immersive engines and DOM productivity. fancy-3d treats both as first-class: 2D React components project onto 3D meshes, 3D scenes embed inside HTML layouts, and the same `Scene` type drives either. react-fancy components are the raison d'être — fancy-3d makes them legible in space.

## Installation

```bash
# core — engine-agnostic: Scene types, <Canvas>, DOM/CSS-3D renderer
npm install @particle-academy/fancy-3d

# optional — react-fancy for the DOM adapter / 2D widgets
npm install @particle-academy/react-fancy

# optional — a WebGL engine adapter (sibling packages, NOT bundled by fancy-3d).
# Pick whichever engine you target; install neither to stay DOM-only:
npm install @particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon @babylonjs/core   # Babylon
npm install @particle-academy/fancy-3d-three   three             # three.js
```

**fancy-3d's own peer dependencies (all optional):** `react >= 18`, `react-dom >= 18`, `@particle-academy/react-fancy`. **fancy-3d has no WebGL-engine dependency** — `@babylonjs/core` / `three` are peers of their respective *adapter* packages, never of fancy-3d itself.

Install only the engines you target — fancy-3d and each adapter are split into subpath imports so unused engines never pull into your bundle.

## Quick Start — the engine-pluggable Canvas

```tsx
import { Canvas } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d/canvas";
import { Card } from "@particle-academy/react-fancy";

// Default: DOM/Web3D — no extra runtime, just a 2D pan/zoom surface
export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <Canvas engine="dom" showGrid className="h-96 w-full">
      <Canvas.Node id="kpi" x={40} y={40} style={{ width: 220, height: 110 }}>
        <Card><Card.Body>Revenue $48k +12%</Card.Body></Card>
      </Canvas.Node>
    </Canvas>
  );
}

// Same JSX, a Babylon scene mounted alongside via the optional adapter package.
// 3D meshes can register against useCanvas().engine.root (the live BABYLON.Scene)
// and share the 2D viewport. Swap to threeEngine from fancy-3d-three to use three.js.
import { babylonEngine } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon/engine";

export function MixedRealityDashboard() {
  return (
    <Canvas engine={babylonEngine} className="h-96 w-full">
      {/* Children render as 2D DOM nodes;
          a sibling component reads useCanvas().engine to add 3D meshes. */}
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

## Quick Start — Scene-driven (legacy DOM/Babylon adapters)

```tsx
import type { Scene } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d";
import { domAdapter } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d/dom";
import { Canvas } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d/canvas";

const scene: Scene = {
  nodes: [
    { id: "rev", position: { x: 0, y: 0 }, size: { w: 220, h: 110 },
      widget: { kind: "kpi", label: "Revenue", value: "$48k", delta: "+12%", trend: "up" } },
  ],
  edges: [],
};

export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <Canvas showGrid className="h-96 w-full">
      {scene.nodes.map((n) => (
        <Canvas.Node key={n.id} id={n.id} x={n.position.x} y={n.position.y}
          style={{ width: n.size?.w, height: n.size?.h }}>
          {domAdapter.render(n.widget, { nodeId: n.id, selected: false })}
        </Canvas.Node>
      ))}
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

To render the same scene in 3D:

```tsx
import { createBabylonAdapter, createBillboard, placeOnCylinder, sceneBounds } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon";

const adapter = createBabylonAdapter({ scene3D: bjScene, sizeFor: (s) => ({ w: 300, h: 200 }) });
const bounds = sceneBounds(scene);
scene.nodes.forEach((node) => {
  const mesh = adapter.render(node.widget, { nodeId: node.id, selected: false });
  placeOnCylinder(node, mesh, bounds);
});
```

## Architecture

`@particle-academy/fancy-3d` exists to deliver `react-fancy` components into 3D environments — in **all the ways a 3D UI might need them**:

| Mode | What | When |
|------|------|------|
| **Texture** | Paint a widget into a `DynamicTexture` and apply it to any primitive's surface. | Static panels, billboards, dashboards, signage. Shipped today. |
| **Mount** | Host a live React tree on a 3D mesh via DOM overlay + `matrix3d` projection — fully interactive, keyboard accessible. | Anywhere you want the actual interactive UI inside a 3D scene. Shipped today via `<Stage>` + `<Monitor>`. |
| **Bump-out / Puffy** | Extruded 3D interpretations of 2D components — buttons that physically protrude, cards with depth, embossed badges. Each interactive subregion is its own pickable mesh. | Spatial / mixed-reality UIs where the interface IS the geometry. Planned. |

The data layer underneath is engine-agnostic — the same `Scene` JSON renders via the built-in DOM/CSS-3D renderer or any WebGL engine through an adapter package (Babylon and three.js ship today). Subpath imports keep the bundle minimal:

```
# fancy-3d core (engine-agnostic — no WebGL dependency)
@particle-academy/fancy-3d           Scene types (Scene, WidgetSpec, WidgetAdapter)
@particle-academy/fancy-3d/dom       DOM adapter — renders Scene to react-fancy components
@particle-academy/fancy-3d/canvas    the engine-pluggable <Canvas> surface

# WebGL engines + <Stage>/<Monitor>/<Card3D> live in OPTIONAL sibling adapter packages:
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon          Babylon adapter + 3D shape primitives
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon/react    <Stage> + <Monitor> (Babylon)
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-babylon/engine   babylonEngine for <Canvas engine={…}>
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three            three.js adapter + 3D shape primitives
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three/react      <Stage> + <Monitor> (three.js)
@particle-academy/fancy-3d-three/engine     threeEngine for <Canvas engine={…}>
```

`react-fancy` is a peer dependency by design: this package exists *to put react-fancy in 3D*, so consumers always install both — the peer relationship just lets you pin the react-fancy version.

## Inertia.js integration

fancy-3d is **not SSR-safe** — WebGL engines need `window` and DOM/CSS3D positioning needs layout measurement. In an Inertia app, wrap every `<Stage>` / `<Monitor>` / `<Card3D>` / `<Canvas engine={babylonEngine}>` in [`<FancyClientOnly>`](https://github.com/Particle-Academy/fancy-inertia/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md#fancyclientonly) from `@particle-academy/fancy-inertia`:

```tsx
import { FancyClientOnly } from "@particle-academy/fancy-inertia";
import { Stage, Monitor } from "@particle-academy/fancy-3d/react";

<FancyClientOnly fallback={<div className="h-[600px] animate-pulse rounded bg-zinc-100" />}>
  <Stage>
    <Monitor position={[0, 1.6, 0]} width={3.2} height={2}>…</Monitor>
  </Stage>
</FancyClientOnly>
```

`<Canvas engine="dom">` (the default) is partially SSR-safe — node tree renders, but pan/zoom only activates client-side. See [fancy-inertia/docs/SSR.md](https://github.com/Particle-Academy/fancy-inertia/blob/main/docs/SSR.md#particle-academyfancy-3d) for the full matrix.
